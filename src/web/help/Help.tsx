        <p>
          This tool is a collection manager for all of your single-player items
          in Diablo 2. You <a href="#saves">select your save folder</a>, the
          tool reads every single character file and stash in it, turning it
          into an <a href="#collection">easily searchable collection</a>. Each
          item is evaluated with a perfection score, so you can quickly identify
          your 35% Spirit without inspecting all of them. When searching for an
          item, the tool gives a precise location to help you find it: "Worn by
          Hammerdin's Mercenary", or "In Fishymancer's Cube".
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use this website as a replacement for GoMule. It allow
          you to{" "}
          <a href="#transfer">transfer items from one character to another</a>,
          either in bulk or a few at a time, and gives you the updated save
          files to download. It can also create an off-game stash to store as
          many items as you need if you do not have enough mules.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are more of a PlugY fan than GoMule, this tool is fully
          PlugY-compatible. If your save folder contains PlugY stashes, these
          are fully parsed too. And it offers a feature to{" "}
          <a href="#organize">fully sort and organize</a> your PlugY stash in
          one click, no matter how many items you hoarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, this website also serves as a{" "}
          <a href="#grail-tracker">Grail tracker</a> that you never have to
          manually update. Simply refresh your save files and you will
          immediately see your progress.
        </p>
      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question="Is this compatible with Diablo 2 Resurrected?">
        Yes! You can seamlessly transfer items between legacy D2 and D2
        Resurrected characters, for instance using your legacy PlugY stash as an
        offline D2R stash.
      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question='When you say "easily searchable", what can I search for?'>
        <p>When searching in your collection, you can search for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Item names: "Tal Rasha"</li>
          <li>Modifiers: "All res"</li>
          <li>Number of sockets: "3 sockets"</li>
          <li>Items in sockets: "Rainbow Facet"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When searching on a character, you can also search for a specific
          location, like "Equipped" or "Mercenary". When searching in a stash,
          you can search for a specific page, like "Shared page 42".
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, like most search tools, using double-quotes " will force a
          perfect match. You can combine this to create advanced searches like:
        </p>
        <blockquote>"4 sockets" "15% enhanced"</blockquote>
        <p>
          To help you find your items in-game, the search results indicate very
          precisely where each item is:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="examples/item-finder.png"
            style="max-width"
            alt="Three Andariel's Visages, one worn by a mercenary, one in a cube, and one on page 48 of the shared stash"
          />
        </p>
      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question='What do you mean by "perfection score"?'>
        <p>
          Many unique and set items have can roll properties and modifiers
          within a range. For instance, Tal Rasha's Lidless Eye can drop +1 or
          +2 to each elemental mastery. This is displayed using brackets next to
          each property that can vary:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="examples/item-info.png"
            style="max-width"
            alt="Three Andariel's Visages, one worn by a mercenary, one in a cube, and one on page 48 of the shared stash"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, it dropped with +1 Cold Mastery, +2 Lightning Mastery
          and +2 Fire Mastery. As such, it has 2 perfect rolls out of 3, which
          makes it "66% perfect".
        </p>

      <FaqSection question="Where am I uploading my save files?">
        Nowhere! Your data is yours, this website does not send anything to the
        server. In fact, once the page has been loaded, the tool works fully
        offline if you want to. If you're not convinced, the entire source code
        for this project is{" "}
        <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/youdz/d2-stash-organizer">
          open-source on GitHub
        </ExternalLink>
        .
      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question="Is this compatible with PlugY?">
        Not only is it fully compatible with PlugY stashes, it also lets you{" "}
        <a href="#organize">fully sort and organize</a> them in one click. We
        all know how long we've been putting off cleaning our stash, well now we
        don't have to!
      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question="How will this sort my very large PlugY stash?">
        <p>
          That's a pretty long answer, but you asked for it. Not that you cannot
          configure the sort order, but you can tell the organizer to leave
          untouched any number of pages at the start of your stash, or tell it
          to add extra empty pages at the beginning.

      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question="Can this be used to edit, hack or mod items?">
        The tool does not have the capability to modify item stats, skills or
        properties. The only fields that can be modified at the moment are the
        ones related to the item's location.
      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question="How do I transfer many items at once?">
        <p>
          Go to <a href="#collection">your collection</a> or a specific{" "}
          <a href="#characters">character or stash page</a>. Search for the
          items you want (or do not search if you want to transfer all items),
          and click the "Select all items" button. This will select all items
          returned by the search. After that, simply go to the{" "}
          <a href="#characters">transfer page</a> and select where you want to
          send them.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no limit to how many items you can transfer at once, provided
          you have enough room at the destination. For instance, you can
          transfer thousands of items in one click from a personal PlugY stash
          to the shared stash:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="examples/bulk-transfer.png"
            alt="Unique normal armors organized by level"
          />
        </p>
      </FaqSection>

      <FaqSection question="How do I transfer all items in a single stash page?">
        Go to <a href="#characters">that stash</a>, and search for the exact
        page name (for instance, "Shared Page 42"). Click the "Select all items"
        button, the <a href="#characters">transfer page</a> will now transfer
        exactly the items in that page.
